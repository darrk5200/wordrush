  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I am Prikshit, a 15-year-old boy who is passionate about tech and entrepreneurship. This is my first website. Earlier, I explored video editing and game development. Game dev flopped because I have a potato PC, but I earned â‚¹6000 from editing (which my parents donâ€™t know about). I think this is enough to know me. ðŸ˜‰</p>
